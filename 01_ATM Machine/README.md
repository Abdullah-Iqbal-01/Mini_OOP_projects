# Digital ATM Project

This project simulates the functionality of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. The program allows users to perform basic ATM operations, such as checking account balance, withdrawing money, and transferring funds, with a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Account Authentication**: Users are prompted to enter their account number and PIN to authenticate.
- **Balance Inquiry**: Users can view their current account balance.
- **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw money from their account, with checks for available balance and withdrawal limits.
- **Transfer Funds**: Users can transfer money to other accounts.
- **Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account.
- **Account Management**: Users can change their PIN and update their account details.

## Technologies Used

- Python (OOP Concepts)
- Standard Python Libraries

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Anaconda (optional, for virtual environments)

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd "path/to/project"
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python p1.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the ATM system.

## How It Works

The project utilizes classes to represent various components of the ATM, such as `Account`, `ATM`, and `Transaction`. Each class contains methods that define the functionality of the ATM system, such as checking balance, withdrawing funds, and transferring money.
